* FAST implementation:
	- Unit test overlap computation up to Neon

* GENERIC implementation:
	- Nuclear-electron attraction:
		~ Implement faster nuclear-electron attraction computation
			* Get access to the paper the faster version is based on
			* Is there no literature that solves this exactly? Or a faster approximation mechanism?
		~ Unit test (both slow and fast implementations)
		~ Add benchmark (also benchmark against slower implementation)
		~ Parallelize the computation?
		~ Finish powerpoint notes for the implementation
	- Electron-electron integral:
		~ Find the paper for this
		~ Add powerpoint notes
		~ Implement the computation
		~ Unit test
		~ Run benchmark
		~ Parallelize the computation?
		~ Finish powerpoint notes (if necessary)
	- Hartree-Fock algorithm
		~ Document the algorithm in powerpoint
		~ Implement the full algorithm
		~ Unit test
		~ Run benchmark
		~ Opportunities to parallelize?
		~ Can any portion be run on the GPU (cuda)?
		~ Read that one paper about Hartree-Fock computation on GPUs
	- Tests:
		~ How accurate are different basis sets? How long do they take to compute?
			* Add support for MANY other basis sets.
			* Add support for more atoms than Calcium (if you think that would be useful)
		~ Once you have a molecule solved, if you change nuclear positions slightly, how 
		  fast is the next computation? In theory, it should be quite a bit faster because
		  you should start with orbitals that are very close to what the final result should be.
			* Generate a graph of nuclear displacement vs. computation time (or nuclear displacement
			  vs. Hartree-Fock iterations) to get an idea of how much longer the computation takes
			  when nuclei move between each iteration.

* Fun extension:
	- Build a modeling application
		~ Build custom molecules and selectively look at electron orbitals
		~ Can we build a web-based application around this?
			* Can you use something like emscriptem?
			* Or would it be better to just do the computation on the backend and then send the
			  results down?
			* How does the 3D modeling on the PDB website work?

* Gradient computation:
	- Understand the one paper that describes gradient computation
	- Are there papers on how to implement?
	- Once you have an implementation and have tested multiple basis sets, eventually we should
	  reach an algorithm that is reasonably accurate (whatever that means...), at which point, 
	  we should implement the faster ("data driven") implementation for all the integral calculations
	  for the given basis set we have decided to use.









Unit Tests
	* Right now, unit tests are just set up to make sure we align with the other
		C++ Hartree-Fock program. Ideally, we should assemble as many unit tests
		as we can where the values actually come from the literature (and therefore,
		we should track those citations). 
			- In thinking about it, I feel like such a set of data might already exist,
			  but if not, then it probably should be created.
