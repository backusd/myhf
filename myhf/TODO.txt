For unit testing, implement logging with colors




Basis Sets
	* Support the following basis sets:
		- STO-3G, STO-6G, 6-31G, 6-31G* [aka 6-31G(d)], 6-31G** [aka 6-31G(d,p)]
	* Support all atoms up to Calcium (20)

Overlap Matrix
	* Make sure we can compute the overlap matrix for a variety of atoms/positions
	* Make sure results align with the Hartree Fock program, PySCF, and published values
	* Look at the PySCF implmentation and look for potential improvements
	* Does it actually help to cache computed values? Is there not a way to simply
		omit any attempt to calculate those values in the first place?

Profiling
	* Go ahead and add profiling now so we have it from the outset

Unit Tests
	* Add unit tests for all computations
	* Cite sources for expected values
