* Start working on the nuclear repulsion matrix



Things to test the performance of:
* A combined Overlap/Kinetic computation function that re-uses s_x,y,z matrices
	- Also test a variant that returns a tuple of MatrixXd vs. taking 2 MatrixXd references
      as out parameters




Basis Sets
	* Support the following basis sets:
		- STO-3G, STO-6G, 6-31G, 6-31G* [aka 6-31G(d)], 6-31G** [aka 6-31G(d,p)]
	* Support all atoms up to Calcium (20)


Unit Tests
	* Right now, unit tests are just set up to make sure we align with the other
		C++ Hartree-Fock program. Ideally, we should assemble as many unit tests
		as we can where the values actually come from the literature (and therefore,
		we should track those citations). 
			- In thinking about it, I feel like such a set of data might already exist,
			  but if not, then it probably should be created.
